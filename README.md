## Editing the content as a content designer

You will need to be a member of the GOV.UK content designers Github group. You
may need to raise a Zendesk ticket pointing 2nd Line at the [instructions for
adding a content designer to Github](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/give-a-content-designer-access-to-github.html).

Edit the [coronavirus landing page content file](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-coronavirus-content/blob/master/content/coronavirus_landing_page.yml) using the little pencil icon.
You can also use [the direct link to edit the file](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-coronavirus-content/edit/master/content/coronavirus_landing_page.yml).

The file is structured in yaml format.
 - The indendation on the left is significant,
 - Key names (the word at the start of each line ending in a colon) are important.

Please don't change these!

Generally you might want to:
 - amend existing lines
 - reorder links within sections
 - add accordion sections

Once you've finished your edits, you'll need to commit the changes and make a
pull request.  (You can ask the on-call dev to help you with this if you like).

You then need to get your pull request approved and merged by someone else.
GOV.UK developers and other members of the GOV.UK Content Design Github team
can do this.

Head over to https://collections-publisher.publishing.service.gov.uk/coronavirus

you may have to fix the content again.

If you're happy that everything looks OK, press "Publish". Check that everything
looks OK and head for the hills.
